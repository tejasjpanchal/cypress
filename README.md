## Information about UI Tests : 

- Scenario 01 : Till the time this test is created, there is no movie with tag "Completed" hence no movie will be selected but test will PASS. Once there is a movie with tag "Completed" available then that movie will be selected.
- Current version of UI Test spec files except "Nicolas_Cage.cy.js" under this project may not run on Firefox browser as the IMDb.com behaves inconsistently on Firefox with Cypress.
- Current version of UI Test spec files under this project will not run on headless mode on Chrome and Firefox as the IMDb.com block the access with 403 forbidden error or Network error for Cypress.
